**ChadChapters originated as a YouTube Bot Account, leaving its mark by automatically commenting on over 500 videos and earning thousands of likes.**
Unfortunately, YouTube banned the account.
The BOT operated as a CRON job utilizing the serverless framework and AWS Lambda, programmatically scanning for new videos from a list of YouTube channels. 
It posted comments on these videos complete with timestamps and chapters.
