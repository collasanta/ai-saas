🚀 This project leverages OpenAI and YouTube APIs to obtain concise summaries, chapters, and keywords for YouTube videos.

**😓 Ever been in a situation where you're eager to watch a video but don't have the time for the entire content?**

With ChadChapters, you can preview video content through organized chapters with timestamps, without the need to watch everything.
This feature lets you jump straight to the sections that pique your interest.

**🤖💬 ChadChapters originated as a YouTube Bot Account, leaving its mark by automatically commenting on over 500 videos and earning thousands of likes from YouTube users.**

The BOT operated as a CRON job utilizing the serverless framework and AWS Lambda, programmatically scanning for new videos from a list of YouTube channels.
It posted comments on these videos with timestamps and chapters, making navigating it easier for watchers.
